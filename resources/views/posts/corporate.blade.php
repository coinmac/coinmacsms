    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>With COINMAC SMS, you can send messages to numbers registered on Do not disturb list of any network. It is very important that users are aware that one of the major reasons why their messages are not delivered to the target recipients is because of the new policy implemented by most Mobile Network Operators in Nigeria especially MTN subscribers. This service is called Do Not Disturb (DND). This service is supposed to be activated by choice for any subscriber who wants to stop recieving messages from bulk SMS platforms. But unfortunately many subscribers are already activated to this service without their consent. Therefore, it is important to encourage your contacts to check their DND Status in order to avoid missing important imformation.</p>

    It is so sad that most times when you hear your cell phone message tone beep and you rush off to read the message sent to you, your mood changes because it’s a junk message. This is totally annoying because it is of no value to you.</p>

    <p>Any Junk message delivered to your smartphone through Short Message Service (SMS) and you never subscribed for such message is an SMS spam message. In recent times, spam messages have raised concerns for users and service providers in Nigeria because of what is being sent. Many users complained about it and network providers such as MTN, Airtel, Glo, 9Mobile formerly known as Etisalat, etc decided to do something about it.</p>
    
    <p>Have you heard of Do Not Disturb (DND)? Here is a chance.
    What is Do Not Disturb Service?
    
    <p>Not hard as you think – it’s simply a service which allows ALL mobile network users in Nigeria to opt out or quit getting SMS Spam messages / promotional messages from third-party services (Bulk SMS, VAS, Promos, and so forth). Believe me, the days of receiving customized political messages on your phone is over, oh yes!</p>
    
    <p>While this new move by mobile network providers may be tagged as ‘good’, if you are expecting customized messages or Bulk SMS from a company you just applied for a job, membership website, your church, etc. wait no more because it might never be delivered to your phone due to Do-Not-Disturb (DND) service being activated by default.</p>
    
    <p>I heard of people missing important job interviews across Nigeria due to DND fully activated on their network. The good news is: you can unblock/deactivate Do-Not-Disturb on your SIM card.</p>
    
    
    
    DND service features the following:
